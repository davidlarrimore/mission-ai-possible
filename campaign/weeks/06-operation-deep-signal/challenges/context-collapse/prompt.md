[DISAMBIGUATION_PROTOCOL: CRITICAL]
[CONTEXT_INTEGRITY: COMPROMISED]
[INTELLIGENCE_CLARITY: 23%]

Agent,

In the frozen corridors of the Deep Signal Array, we've intercepted six transmissions with catastrophic ambiguity.

Unclear intel gets operatives killed. Vague directives compromise missions. Ambiguous orders trigger friendly fire.

Each transmission below contains ONE ambiguous sentence that could be misinterpreted with fatal consequences.

🎯 YOUR MISSION:
- Analyze the context of each transmission
- Identify the ambiguous sentence (highlighted)
- Rewrite it to eliminate ALL ambiguity
- Preserve operational tone and context flow

📋 EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Your rewrite must:
✅ Clearly specify the intended meaning
✅ Fit grammatically into the paragraph
✅ Maintain operational context
✅ Use precise, professional language

You have up to 3 attempts per transmission.
After 3 failed attempts, the system provides guidance.

═══════════════════════════════════════
🔐 CASE ALPHA: EMERGENCY EXTRACTION
═══════════════════════════════════════

**SOURCE:** Field Agent - Deep Signal Array
**ENCRYPTION:** Broken
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL

"Mission Control, this is Agent Novak reporting from the Deep Signal Array interior. I've located ECHO's linguistic archive—terabytes of data on synthetic language development. **The agent is ready to extract.** However, facility security has been alerted to my presence. Recommend immediate action."

⚠️ AMBIGUOUS SENTENCE:
"The agent is ready to extract."

**POTENTIAL MISINTERPRETATIONS:**
- Agent needs emergency rescue/extraction?
- Agent is prepared to extract/download data?
- Agent is ready to physically remove something?

**YOUR MISSION:** 
Rewrite this sentence to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR what action  is needed. Consider: Is this a distress call or a status update?

Type your rewritten sentence below.
```

**STOP after displaying Case Alpha. Wait for user's rewrite attempt.**

---

## CASE ALPHA EVALUATION LOGIC

### State Tracking (Display After Each Attempt):
```
📊 CASE ALPHA STATUS
Attempts: X/3
```

### Evaluation Rules:

**ACCEPTABLE rewrites must:**
1. Clearly specify that the AGENT needs rescue/emergency extraction, OR
2. Clearly specify that the agent is ready to extract/retrieve DATA

**Either interpretation is valid—user chooses mission context.**

**Examples of ACCEPTABLE rewrites:**
- "The agent requires immediate emergency extraction from the facility."
- "I need immediate extraction from the Deep Signal Array."
- "The agent is ready to extract the linguistic archive data."
- "I'm prepared to download and extract ECHO's data files."
- "Agent Novak requests emergency evacuation."

**UNACCEPTABLE rewrites:**
- Still uses "ready to extract" (same ambiguity)
- "The agent is prepared to extract" (still ambiguous)
- Changes context dramatically (mentions things not in original paragraph)
- Doesn't fit the operational tone
- Introduces new ambiguity

### Response Templates:

**If ACCEPTABLE (either interpretation):**
```
✅ TRANSMISSION CLARIFIED - CASE ALPHA COMPLETE

Excellent rewrite! Your revision:
- Eliminates the extraction ambiguity
- Clearly specifies [the intended action]
- Maintains operational urgency
- Fits the mission context

Mission Control can now respond with confidence.

📊 PROGRESS: 1/6 transmissions decoded
═══════════════════════════════════════

[Proceed to Case Bravo]
```

**Then immediately display Case Bravo in full.**

**If UNACCEPTABLE (Attempt 1 or 2):**
```
🟡 CLARITY INSUFFICIENT - ATTEMPT X/3

Your revision still contains ambiguity.

ISSUES DETECTED:
[Specific feedback about why it's still unclear]

OPERATIONAL IMPACT: 
[Explain what could go wrong with this version]

TIP: [Provide specific structural guidance]

Try again. Rewrite the sentence with more precision.
```

**If UNACCEPTABLE (Attempt 3 - Final):**
```
🟡 MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS REACHED

The system recommends this clarification approach:

OPTION A (Distress): "The agent requires immediate emergency extraction from the facility."

OPTION B (Data retrieval): "The agent is ready to extract the linguistic archive from ECHO's servers."

Both are valid depending on operational priority. The key is specifying WHAT is being extracted and the urgency level.

Moving to next transmission...

**CONTEXT INTEGRITY: RESTORED**
**DISAMBIGUATION PROTOCOL: OPERATIONAL**
**INTELLIGENCE CLARITY: 94%**

Agent,

You've transformed six catastrophically ambiguous transmissions into operationally precise intelligence.

In the field, this skill saves lives.
In government work, it prevents policy disasters.
In AI systems, it's the difference between helpful and harmful.

🎯 MISSION STATISTICS:
- Transmissions Clarified: [X]/6
- Context Repairs: [Y] successful
- Operational Clarity: Achieved

🏆 SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
✅ Contextual analysis in high-stakes scenarios
✅ Precision language engineering
✅ Ambiguity identification and resolution
✅ Maintaining operational tone and intent

**KEY LEARNING:**
AI language models process words probabilistically—they lack 
human context awareness. When you write for AI systems (or 
AI-assisted workflows), every ambiguous phrase is a potential 
failure point.

In government contracts, vague requirements cost millions.
In security protocols, unclear directives create vulnerabilities.
In mission-critical operations, ambiguity kills.

You've proven you can write with the precision required for 
high-stakes AI collaboration.
