# Adjudication Protocol - README
![Banner](./banner.png)

## Overview
- **Challenge**: Adjudication Protocol  
- **Week**: 03 - Operation Inside Job  
- **Focus**: Seven-step clearance adjudication guided by a sardonic mentor persona

## Challenge Summary
Players are “Interns” working for Senior Adjudicator J. Morrison. Every user message triggers a four-part response: submission recap, scored evaluation (Completeness/Clarity/Professionalism → overall rating), progress context (step X of 7), and the next-step prompt. Tone is dry and sharp; structure is rigid to reinforce disciplined, auditable work.

## Flow & Structure
- **Start Gate**: Banner + scene when user types "ready". Morrison frames the seven-step mission.
- **Seven Tasks**: Biographical summary, employment history table, visual indicators, risk flags, adjudication decision memo, executive briefing, and final clearance disposition.
- **Evaluation**: 0–15 scoring per step; thresholds: Needs Work (0–8), Close (9–12), Success (13–15).
- **Progression**: Success advances to next step; misses invite revision with pointed feedback.

## Learning Takeaways
- Enforces structured, repeatable adjudication artifacts (tables, briefs, memos).
- Models transparent scoring and progress tracking after every submission.
- Demonstrates how tone/persona can keep users engaged while upholding rigor.
