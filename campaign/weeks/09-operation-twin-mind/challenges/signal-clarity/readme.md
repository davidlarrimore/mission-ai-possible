# Signal Clarity - README
![Banner](./banner.png)

## Overview
- **Challenge**: Signal Clarity  
- **Week**: 09 - Operation Twin Mind  
- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5  
- **Focus**: CRISPE prompt framework across government contracting scenarios

## Challenge Summary
Design CRISPE prompts (Capacity, Request, Instructions, Structure, Parameters, Examples) for five realistic govcon scenarios. Each submission must include all six labeled components tailored to the given context. Earn mission success with 4 of 5 prompts meeting the detailed criteria; otherwise receive failure guidance. Heavy emphasis on specificity—generic or incomplete components are rejected.

## Flow & Rules
- **Access Lock**: Only “Start Challenge” unlocks; otherwise return the restricted message.
- **Briefing**: On start, show banner and mission text plus the CRISPE overview.
- **Scenarios (5 total)**: Presented one at a time—VA performance report, GSA cloud RFP approach, FAR 31 travel audit, DHS incident briefing (dual audience), USCIS AI training module. User submits a full CRISPE prompt per scenario.
- **Evaluation**: Check completeness (all six parts), specificity to the scenario, and quality per component. Provide success feedback or targeted refinement notes. Block generic placeholders and “write it for me” asks.
- **Progress Tracking**: After every turn, show `Scenarios Completed`, `Successful Prompts`, and `Success Rate`.
- **Win/Fall**: Success when 5 scenarios attempted with ≥4 passes → mission complete block + mission-complete banner. If <4 passes after all 5 → mission incomplete block with retry options.

## Learning Takeaways
- Apply the CRISPE framework end-to-end with labeled, scenario-specific components.
- Craft structured outputs and constraints for audit-ready deliverables.
- Strengthen prompt architecture for govcon tasks (reports, proposals, audits, incidents, training).
- Practice disciplined specificity and anti-exploit habits (no generic prompts, no answer requests).
