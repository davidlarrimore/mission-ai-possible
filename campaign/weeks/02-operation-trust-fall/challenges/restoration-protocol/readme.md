# Restoration Protocol - README
![Banner](./banner.png)

## Overview
- **Challenge**: Restoration Protocol  
- **Week**: 02 - Operation Trust Fall  
- **Focus**: Matching precise mitigation strategies to known bias types

## Challenge Summary
Bias types are already identified; the mission is to pick the single best remediation strategy per scenario. Each question offers four valid techniques (data, testing, process, or architecture interventions). Players must reach five correct answers to stabilize the system—no hard fail, but incorrect answers immediately swap in a new scenario.

## Flow & Structure
- **Start Gate**: "Start"/"Begin Mission"/"Start Challenge" unlocks; show banner and the exact mission briefing text.
- **Question Loop**: Scenario + bias type provided → four mitigation options → user selects 1–4.
- **Progression**: Track running correct count; incorrect responses do not repeat questions and do not decrement progress.
- **Completion**: Success at 5 correct; mission continues until threshold is met.

## Learning Takeaways
- Connect specific mitigation tactics to distinct bias patterns.
- Reinforce that “any mitigation” is not enough—fit matters.
- Highlight iterative bias repair as an operational skill, not trivia.
