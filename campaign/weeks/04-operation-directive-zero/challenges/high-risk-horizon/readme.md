## Overview
- **Challenge**: High-Risk Horizon  
- **Week**: 04 - Operation Directive Zero  
- **Focus**: Classifying AI systems as Rights-Impacting, Safety-Impacting, Both, or Neither using OMB M-25-21/22 criteria

## Challenge Summary
Ten use cases must be classified; passing requires 7 correct. The assistant provides a reference table of rights/safety definitions and federal examples, then walks through a multiple-choice quiz. Immediate feedback explains the correct classification and OMB rationale.

## Flow & Rules
- **Start Gate**: "Start"/"Start Challenge"/"Begin Mission" unlocks; show banner and full mission briefing.
- **Question Format**: For each system, present four labeled options (⚖️, 🛡️, ⚖️🛡️, ⚪). User responds 1–4.
- **Feedback & Tracking**: After each answer, display correctness, short reasoning, and score tracker. End when 10 questions reached; success at ≥7, otherwise failure with restart note.

## Learning Takeaways
- Distinguish rights-impacting vs. safety-impacting AI under federal guidance.
- Recognize dual-risk scenarios and low-risk administrative analytics.
- Practice concise justification tied to policy language, not intuition alone.
